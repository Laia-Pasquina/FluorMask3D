# FluorMask3D
FluorMask3D was designed to analyse multichannel images and automatically create binary masks, overlay them in the fluorescence channels and measure the intensity values of different markers in a specific region, all with 3D data. Example of data was done in Eukaryotic cells spheroids in 3D
